# Fleetguard_EV02_Back

Implementation of a microservices-based system with the following operations:

- Real-time location tracking of transport units  
- Create, update and delete transport units  
- Authenticate users and protect endpoints using **JWT**


The system is composed of:
- `microservice-fleetLocation` (location and transport unit management)
- `microservice-authentication` (user auth and JWT)
- `api-gateway` (entry point and route protection)
- `service-discovery` (Eureka)
